        <li>"When these paintings are being duplicated or viewed through a camera or film, a close-up or detailed view of the painting can completely change the whole meaning of the painting itself. The parts of the painting are arranged into a
          narrative which unfolds depending on their showtime (rather the original painting unfolds everything simultaneously)."</li>
