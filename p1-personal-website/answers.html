      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 2 - SEPTEMBER 16 - INTERNET HISTORY</h2>
      <p class="answer">If I was part of the government before the 1970s, I probably wouldn't have done much different from what happened in history (by reason of war at the time). However, if I was just any citizen, I would use it to communicate and
        familiarize
        with people from other parts of the world. To be realistic, the Great Man Theory is most likely not possible. Therefore, I would be more likely to be successful in a team. To begin, I would gather a group of individuals who are motivated to
        experiment on this journey with me. Next, in order to carry out this idea, I would write out a proposal to the government to fund for this project. If not, another method is to get acces to institutional funds or with charity support.</p>

      <p class="answer">Over many years of using the internet, I have learned that the best knowledge comes from observing and critically thinking about different people and their cultures. To do so, an open-source communication will certainly allow
        more people to
        access others and build a better understanding as to why things are the way they are. <em><strong>Understanding</strong></em> is a valuable skill to have as a human being, because it becomes essential for the survival of humans.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 3 - SEPTEMBER 23 - GLOBAL NETWORK ISSUES</h2>
      <p class="answer">If I was hired to re-design the network infrastructure of my country, my proposed course of action would be to allow equal internet access to everyone. No matter where you are in the world, it should be a basic human right to
        have access to
        the internet. Restricting the use of internet among individuals would limit their knowledge of the world around them, which would manipulate their freedom to live their own lives to the fullest. Speaking about equality brings me further into
        the issue of slavery, which occurs from coltan mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The reality of such toxic working conditions is a violation to human rights and rises environmental concerns, which means that those slaves will suffer
        from a poor quality of life, even death. So, in such cases, I would go to the extent to ensure safety working conditions such as providing better mining tools in addition to a fair income for the workers.</p>

    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 4 - SEPTEMBER 30 - INTERNET ART</h2>
      <p class="answer">I suppose that when artists discovered the potential of the internet, many wanted to push it further to see what that could bring about in their creative work. In my view, a successful artist should be able to present their
        work in a more personalized and unique way (as well as in an aesthetically pleasing way). The personalized sites in the early web were a bit extreme but also presented a greater freedom to explore how they want to present themselves on the
        web (even to the point of coding it themselves). I believe it is these special and personalized sites that what makes them successful, as they attract many people and bring the netizen community together. Although I do have to say, the
        vibrant colors and the constant clutter of elements from the early web does come out to be confusing and painful on the eyes.</p>

      <p class="answer">In contrast, companies today offer lots of templates to build websites. However, this limits user from customizing their site which lacks any personal touches, because people are focused on marketing their work. The
        normalization of constant marketing through media made the web a “busy place” today, which probably also influenced the way we perceive good design to be plain and minimalistic.

      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 5 - OCTOBER 7 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
      <p class="answer">As an executive in the software division of Omnicorp, my strategy would be similar to the GNU project. I would grab the students’ attention from Conkers University by offering scholarships and awards for presenting good work
        for the
        Omnicorp. For example, I could host events, competitions, and other extra-curricular activities. I would then further proceed by arranging a lab dedicated to research, experimentation, workshops and tutorials. In addition, I would offer jobs
        and introduce experts in the industry. These experts can present a chance for these students to bring out their potential in the field of programming and most importantly, building connections.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 7 - OCTOBER 21 - GENDER & IDEOLOGY IN SOFTWARE</h2>
      <p class="answer">I could make a survey on a website or social media where I anonymously ask the employees how they feel about the work environment (and other questions like, “what is your average salary?”). Then, use that data to create a
        poster to put up around the company building. Or, I can advocate for equal pay by anonymously starting a campaign with the company’s activity coordinator (or a similar position). For example, we could provide lunch for the workers where women
        get half price, while men get full price. That way, people can begin to get awareness for equal pay and hopefully, the message will reach to the authorities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 8 - OCTOBER 28 - HACKER CULTURE</h2>
      <p class="answer">If my hacking skills allow me to, then I would try to hack the vaccine data to see how they were made and who and what were involved in the making of the vaccines. Aaron Swartz was a bright individual with good intentions, but
        his determination and ambition to change the world for the better have caused conflict towards government laws. So, in my case, I would anonymously create an article online to publicly inform the safety measures/ risks behind the materials
        that went into the making of the vaccine. By distributing the information anonymously, I can safely gather opinions from a greater population and hopefully pressure the company to lower the costs. </p>

    <div class="grid-item">
      <h2 class="subtitle">WEEK 10 - NOVEMBER 11 - COMMODIFICATION & RECUPERATION </h2>
      <p class="answer">If Pepsi did hire me to be in their ad, I would most definitely accept it. My family has sacrificed a lot for me, so I want to use this chance to return the favor. If after there is a remaining sum of money, I can donate it to victims of slavery and homeless people as well. Personally, as someone who’s dealing with the consequences of overconsuming sugary drinks, I do not support Pepsi. Despite this fact, I would still take this chance as I assume working in this field will be a bit slow before I start earning a good income. From the readings of “The Californian Ideology”, I refuse to enjoy libertarian individualism while not acknowledging the ideas from counter-culture. However, as an utilitarianist person, I am also not comfortable dealing with chaos, because I know that having a big following will have their own hardships as well. So, rather than explicitly expressing my thoughts about such ideas and creating debate, I would produce artworks that would evoke discussion and various interpretation (such that I create a counter cultural community of my own).</p>
