      <p>If I was part of the government before the 1970s, I probably wouldn't have done much different from what happened in history (by reason of war at the time). However, if I was just any citizen, I would use it to communicate and familiarize with people from other parts of the world. To be realistic, the Great Man Theory is most likely not possible. Therefore, I would be more likely to be successful in a team. To begin, I would gather a group of individuals who are motivated to experiment on this journey with me. Next, in order to carry out this idea, I would write out a proposal to the government to fund for this project. If not, another method is to get acces to institutional funds or with charity support.<br><br>

      Over many years of using the internet, I have learned that the best knowledge comes from observing and critically thinking about different people and their cultures. To do so, an open-source communication will certainly allow more people to access others and build a better understanding as to why things are the way they are. <em><strong>Understanding</strong></em> is a valuable skill to have as a human being, because it becomes essential for the survival of humans.</p>
