      <h2 class="subtitle3">WEEK 2 - SEPTEMBER 16 - INTERNET HISTORY</h2>
      <p class="answer">If I was part of the government before the 1970s, I probably wouldn't have done much different from what happened in history (by reason of war at the time). However, if I was just any citizen, I would use it to communicate and
        familiarize
        with people from other parts of the world. To be realistic, the Great Man Theory is most likely not possible. Therefore, I would be more likely to be successful in a team. To begin, I would gather a group of individuals who are motivated to
        experiment on this journey with me. Next, in order to carry out this idea, I would write out a proposal to the government to fund for this project. If not, another method is to get acces to institutional funds or with charity support.</p>

      <p class="answer">Over many years of using the internet, I have learned that the best knowledge comes from observing and critically thinking about different people and their cultures. To do so, an open-source communication will certainly allow
        more people to
        access others and build a better understanding as to why things are the way they are. <em><strong>Understanding</strong></em> is a valuable skill to have as a human being, because it becomes essential for the survival of humans.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle3">WEEK 3 - SEPTEMBER 23 - GLOBAL NETWORK ISSUES</h2>
      <p class="answer">If I was hired to re-design the network infrastructure of my country, my proposed course of action would be to allow equal internet access to everyone. No matter where you are in the world, it should be a basic human right to
        have access to
        the internet. Restricting the use of internet among individuals would limit their knowledge of the world around them, which would manipulate their freedom to live their own lives to the fullest. Speaking about equality brings me further into
        the issue of slavery, which occurs from coltan mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The reality of such toxic working conditions is a violation to human rights and rises environmental concerns, which means that those slaves will suffer
        from a poor quality of life, even death. So, in such cases, I would go to the extent to ensure safety working conditions such as providing better mining tools in addition to a fair income for the workers.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle3">WEEK 4 - SEPTEMBER 30 - INTERNET ART</h2>
      <p class="answer">I suppose that when artists discovered the potential of the internet, many wanted to push it further to see what that could bring about in their creative work. In my view, a successful artist should be able to present their
        work in a more personalized and unique way (as well as in an aesthetically pleasing way). The personalized sites in the early web were a bit extreme but also presented a greater freedom to explore how they want to present themselves on the
        web (even to the point of coding it themselves). I believe it is these special and personalized sites that what makes them successful, as they attract many people and bring the netizen community together. Although I do have to say, the
        vibrant colors and the constant clutter of elements from the early web does come out to be confusing and painful on the eyes.</p>

      <p class="answer">In contrast, companies today offer lots of templates to build websites. However, this limits user from customizing their site which lacks any personal touches, because people are focused on marketing their work. The
        normalization of constant marketing through media made the web a “busy place” today, which probably also influenced the way we perceive good design to be plain and minimalistic.

      <h2 class="subtitle3">WEEK 5 - OCTOBER 7 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
      <p class="answer">As an executive in the software division of Omnicorp, my strategy would be similar to the GNU project. I would grab the students’ attention from Conkers University by offering scholarships and awards for presenting good work for the
        Omnicorp. For example, I could host events, competitions, and other extra-curricular activities. I would then further proceed by arranging a lab dedicated to research, experimentation, workshops and tutorials. In addition, I would offer jobs
        and introduce experts in the industry. These experts can present a chance for these students to bring out their potential in the field of programming and most importantly, building connections.</p>
