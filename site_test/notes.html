        <h3>2017 DETROIT PROJECT:</h3>

        <h3>COLTAN MINING IN EASTERN CONGO (2016):</h3>
        <li>Coltan can be found in our everyday devices.</li>
        <li>Everyone including pregnant women and children are forced to do heavy labor and dig up Coltan under dangerous working conditions (ex. Bare foot, unsanitary water, poor working tools.)</li>
        <li>Unsanitary water and air often lead to unhealthy lives (ex. tumors from drinking water, very sick babies, etc.)</li>
        <li>
          <ul>These workers earn as little as $2 a day.
            <li>The ugly reality is that <em>We</em> are driving this, because we all want cheap products.</li>
            <li>Companies are also doing so because they think they can put their money to "better use".</li>

        <h3>JOHN BERGER'S 1972 DOCUMENTARY SERIES: WAYS OF SEEING:</h3>
        <li>Paintings at the beginning of their time had much more meaning to where they were located. <strong>We had to go to them</strong> (ex. The Church). Nowadays, these paintings can be found through any of our screens.<strong>The paintings
            come to us.</strong></li>
        <li>"When these paintings are being duplicated or viewed through a camera or film, a close-up or detailed view of the painting can completely change the whole meaning of the painting itself. The parts of the painting are arranged into a
          narrative which unfolds depending on their showtime (rather the original painting unfolds everything simultaneously)."</li>
        <li>The context of a painting can also change from its other surrounding images/ media/ music and the things presented before and after it.</li>
      </ul>
